		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p>The Mage Security Council promotes and facilitates secure Magento stores globally.</p>

		<h2>Why</h2>
		<p>The Council's primary objective is to increase Magento's market share. The best way to do that is to improve the experience merchants have with Magento. Attacks on e-commerce have become more numerous and sophisticated in recent years, and so the complexity of counter measures has increased. This requires collaborative effort.</p>

		<h2>Who</h2>
		<p>The Council is a joint effort of specialized Magento hosting providers, who recognized the growing security needs of Magento merchants and agencies. The Council is a non-profit iniative and welcomes new members who actively contribute to the Magento brand and the improved security of the ecosystem.</p>	 

		<h2>What</h2>
		<p>Members of the Council collaborate on mitigation research and produce practical security tools for the benefit of the community. Specific tasks</p>
		<ul class="msc-listing">
			<li>Educate the community on the relevance of security and best practices.</li>
			<li>Empower merchants to improve the security of their store, by providing tools for front and back-end scanning</li>
			<li>Maintain up to date malware signatures. Once new malware is conceived, it can be eradicated promptly.</li>
			<li>Maintain a normalized list of security vulnerabilities. This allows site maintainers to quickly gauge whether they are running outdated extensions.</li>
			<li>Resolve compromised sites globally by contacting authorities, network and system administrators.</li>
		</ul>
